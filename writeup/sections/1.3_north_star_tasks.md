## Task categories by complexity

**Core capabilities to enable**
- Represent documents by arbitrary natural language instructions
- Pay ingestion cost once, query flexibly
- Embedding models with built-in reasoning capabilities
- Hypernetwork-style conditional embeddings

**Task types**
- Attribute extraction
- Abstractive reasoning / semantic group-by
- Deep semantic similarity beyond lexical/surface features

**Use case patterns**
- "Are these two responses equivalent with respect to X?"
- "Is description A applicable to instance B?"
- Finding unlikely semantic neighbors
- Identifying shared cultural/historical/thematic connections

### Extractive/categorical tasks
Simple reasoning over categorical criteria that can be extracted from documents.

**Reviews and sentiment**
- Movie reviews by sentiment
- Movie reviews by topic/semantic content
- Restaurant reviews by sentiment
- Restaurant reviews by aspect

**Intent classification**
- Banking queries by intent
- Chat prompts by degree of open-endedness

**Structured reasoning (math)**
- GSM8K problems by units of final answer
- GSM8K problems by arithmetic/mathematical structure of solution

**Code analysis**
- Code by big O complexity
- Code by big O complexity relative to optimal

### Multi-hop and compositional tasks
Tasks requiring multiple steps of reasoning or combining information.

**Crossword clues**
- By clue type
- By domain/subject matter of answer
- By answer itself
- By obscurity of answer
- By obfuscation strategy (regardless of topic)

**Creative content**
- Songs by key signature
- Songs by emotional tenor
- Poems by sentiment
- Poems by theme
- Technical blog posts by topic
- Technical blog posts by "voice-ey-ness"

**Academic content**
- Papers by methodology
- Abstracts by prototypical contribution

### Complex reasoning with sparse matches
Tasks where positive matches are rare or require deep semantic understanding.

**Narrative analysis**
- ROCStories by abstract narrative events
- ROCStories by explicit or implied setting
- Stories by source of tension
- Short stories by central theme
- Taxonomy of opening lines

**Visual art**
- Paintings by lighting quality
- Paintings by source of tension
- Paintings by implied narrative arc
- Paintings by "figures aware of being observed"

**Advanced semantic concepts**
- Garden path sentences by misdirection mechanism
- Subversion (weird in the same way)
- Thematic resonances
- Historical resonances
- Literary allusions
- Shared cultural references
- Anachronistic neighbors (e.g., "17th century painting close to 1980s photograph")

## Application domains

### Business applications

**Customer support**
- Chats by outcome
- Chats by topic
- Chats by implicit customer attitude toward AI chatbot

**Product and marketing**
- Product descriptions by market positioning
- Product descriptions by presumed market
- Recommendation systems ("You may also like")
- Business insights extraction

**Domain-specific use cases**
- Drug investments by expected return
- Drug investments by safety impacts
- Drug investments by customer satisfaction

### Research and technical applications

**Reasoning evaluation**
- PRM: reasoning traces by outcome
- Method embeddings: reasoning traces by process/method

**Existing research datasets**
- D5 news headlines
- AbstractSim pairs

### Visual/image classification

**Symbolic/archetypal concepts**
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (5 levels)
- Big Five Personality Traits
- Seven Deadly Sins
- Ten Commandments
- Four Noble Truths (Buddhism)
- Four Classical Elements
- Seven Days of Creation
- Seven Basic Plots
- Five senses
- Nine muses
- Five stages of grief
- Seven circles of hell

**Temporal/aesthetic categorization**
- Decades aesthetics
- Anachronistic similarities


### Motivating examples and use cases

#### Real-world criteria-specific semantic similarity tasks
- Are these two responses equivalent with respect to XYZ?
- Is description ABC applicable to instance XYZ?
- "deep semantic similarity" - examples
- "types" of math problems, associative connections
- Unlikely Semantic neighbors
- Anachronistic neighbors: "this 17th century painting is weirdly close to this 1980s photograph"

#### Visual/image queries - fun queries to run through the image system
- paintings by TROPES
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (5 levels)
- Big Five Personality Traits (5)
- Seven Deadly Sins (7)
- Ten Commandments (10)
- Four Noble Truths (4) (Buddhism)
- Four Classical Elements (4)
- Seven Days of Creation (7)
- Seven Basic Plots (7)
- The five senses
- The 9 muses
- Decades aesthetics
- In general, these clearly-clustered things kind of work well
	- The five stages of grief
	- The seven circles of hell

#### High-level motivations
- The ability to represent documents by arbitrary natural language instructions
- Pay an ingestion cost
- Embedding models should have reasoning -> generate embedding
- Hypernetwork

#### Specific domain applications
- PRM: reasoning traces by outcome
- lm_evals "method embeddings" - embed reasoning traces by method/process

### Business and application examples

#### Overall task types
- attribute extraction
