## Baseline: embedding models WITH document rewriting
- generation cost: O(n)
- embedding cost: O(n)

query rewriting, For hard stuff, to happen All the time


variant:
does the multi summary method work like this:
do 16 rewrites and take the max sim (supposedly, rewrite doesn’t work because it’s too open ended… so just try this)



The challenge with using an LM rewriter is canonicalizing the rewritten descriptions across examples.
Options: (1) make a document rewriter that uses a shared schema (2) make an embedding model that is really good at equivalence
