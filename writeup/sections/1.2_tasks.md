## Document sets and criteria
- Here are some examples of datasets/criteria we care about
	- GSM8K questions and solutions, computation graph used to compute the solution
	- Crossword clues, type of clue
	- Crossword clues, subject of the answer
	- Jokes, what makes them funny
	- Jokes, topic area or what they are generally about
	- Speech snippets, what kinds of rhetorical devices are used
	- Poetry lines, what kind of figurative language is used
	- Math olympiad problems, techniques necessary to solve
	- War game scenarios, underlying principles for decision making
	- We are most interested in tasks that aren't trivial, cookie-cutter classification tasks and require some kind of reasoning to get correct.






For a summary of all tasks, see [TASKS_TABLE.md](TASKS_TABLE.md).
