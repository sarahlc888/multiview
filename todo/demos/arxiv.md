Need surprising connections



Imagine: you have an arXiv dump
You embed the papers using the standard arXiv P2P thingy, or with an instruction

Hypothesis: the embeddings are not that good, and we profit from distilling


Tbh should do query likelihood on the query rewrites
For complicated stuff ... just on the buffer, not on the corpus



Embed arxiv papers by concepts
In a fine grained manner
Like within a particular cluster

By their insights and sensibilities
Eg free lunch stuff
Neftune
John’s simple instruction thingy
LIMA
URIAL

Eg whatever. So not about the domain but the insights and sensibilities.


By contributions

Eat their lunch
