- We could pour more compute on and get better triples




- [ ] ==write it all up and get a proper leaderboard==
- [ ] eval on the prelabeled data for all of these extractive properties.... (==prelabeled stuff gives us a bunch of well vetted data for free....==)
- [ ] run aidanbench as an eval benchmark





I mean what is the hold up

One thing is that there is a limit to what it generalizes ... there are instances where the data looks like shit and that's pretty blocker-ey

- [ ] Leaderboard
- [ ] Good Triplets - 200 triplets for each document set
- [ ] Automatic table showing an anchor positive and negative of each generated thing. To make it just really clear what it is that we’re talking about
