One of the baselines should be to generate a ton of instance specific criteria and just make a vector of scores? Yeah
The goal is to generate a ton of criteria and be able to make embeddings for each of those criteria, so we can calcualte diversity over a lot of dimensions
AKA get a better diversity score via decomposition.......
