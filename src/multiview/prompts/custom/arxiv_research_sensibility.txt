What is the paper's abstract intellectual stance or philosophical approach to research? What is its sensibility about how to make progress?

Key sensibilities:

- Scaling & Resources
  - "More is more": Scaling up (bigger models, more data, more compute) as the path to progress
  - "Less is more": Efficiency, minimalism, pruning, doing more with less
  - "Compute is all you need": Raw compute will solve problems that clever algorithms cannot
  - "Data-centric": Data quality and curation matter more than model architecture

- Tradeoffs & Surprises
  - "No free lunch": Demonstrating fundamental tradeoffs, limitations, or costs
  - "Surprising free lunch": Discovering unexpected wins or getting something for nothing
  - "Pareto improvement": Finding ways to improve multiple objectives simultaneously

- Epistemology & Understanding
  - "Mechanistic understanding": Know *how* things work inside, not just *that* they work
  - "Behavioral understanding": Characterize what a system does without internal access
  - "Negative results matter": Value in showing what doesn't work and why
  - "Benchmarks are broken": Current evaluation doesn't capture what we care about

- Methodology
  - "Empiricism rules": Let experiments decide, measure everything, ablate thoroughly
  - "Theory first": Start from principles, prove guarantees, derive from formal frameworks
  - "Toy problems first": Build intuition on simplified settings before scaling up
  - "Real-world grounding": Only problems that matter in deployment are worth solving

- Aesthetics & Values
  - "Elegance matters": Prefer simple, unified, aesthetically pleasing solutions
  - "Whatever works": Pragmatic engineering, combine anything that helps
  - "Unification": Connect disparate subfields under a common framework

- Generalization & Scope
  - "Transfer everywhere": Methods should generalize across domains, tasks, and distributions
  - "Specialization wins": Custom solutions for specific problems outperform generic approaches

- Progress & Change
  - "Rethink foundations": Question basic assumptions or propose new formulations
  - "Incrementalism": Steady improvements through careful engineering and tuning
  - "Standing on shoulders": Build carefully and explicitly on prior work
  - "Clean slate": Start fresh, ignore prior approaches on the wrong track

- Risk & Safety
  - "Red teaming": Find failure modes, adversarial cases, worst-case scenarios
  - "Safety first": Prioritize alignment, robustness, avoiding harms
  - "Capability first": Push the frontier now, handle risks later
  - "Hidden costs": Revealing overlooked costs in methods that seem to work well

- Community & Practice
  - "Democratization": Make techniques accessible without massive resources
  - "Fairness first": Prioritize equitable outcomes, audit for bias, consider who benefits and who's harmed
  - "Reproducibility matters": Results should be independently verifiable
  - "Interdisciplinary": Import ideas and methods from other fields

Consider the paper's implicit philosophy about research progress, what makes a good solution, and what counts as understanding.
