Consider the arithmetic structure of the solution.

There are many different types of arithmetic “computational graphs”. Here is a compact taxonomy.

A. simple sum or difference
e.g. answer = a + b
e.g. answer = a - b

B. simple product
e.g. answer = a * b

C. simple quotient
e.g. answer = a / b

D. sum of products (add multiple terms)
e.g. answer = a*b + c*d

E. fractional ratio of two sum-or-difference expressions
e.g. answer = (a + b) / (c - d)
e.g. answer = (a + b) / (c + d)

F. product of sums (distributive structure)
e.g. answer = (a + b) * (c + d)

G. other type of parallel branches then combine (compute two sub-results, then combine)
e.g. answer = (a + b) * (c - d)

H. chained updates (multi-step state changes)
e.g. answer = ((a + b) - c) * d
e.g. answer = (a * b) + c

I. parallel branches -> chained updates
e.g. answer = (a*b + c*d) / (a + c)

Instruction: choose the SINGLE best letter for the overall structure. If multiple apply, choose the best fit. Output ONLY the letter.
