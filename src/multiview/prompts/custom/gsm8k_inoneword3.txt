Consider the arithmetic structure of the solution.

There are many different types of arithmetic “computational graphs”. Here is a compact taxonomy.

A. simple sum or difference
e.g. answer = a + b
e.g. answer = a - b

B. simple product or quotient
e.g. answer = a * b
e.g. answer = a / b

C. parallel branches then combine
e.g. sum of products: answer = a*b + c*d
e.g. product of sums: answer = (a + b) * (c + d)
e.g. answer = (a + b) / (c - d)
e.g. answer = (a + b) * (c - d)

D. chained update steps
e.g. answer = a + b*c
e.g. a * b / c
e.g. answer = (c - b)/a
e.g. ratio / proportion (cross-multiply) : a/b = c/d  =>  a*d = b*c

E. simple product or quotient
e.g. answer = a * b
e.g. answer = a / b

F. multi-step chained updates
e.g. answer = ((a + b) - c) * d

G. multi-step after parallel structure
e.g. answer = (a*b + c*d) / (a + c)

H. other

Instruction: choose the SINGLE best letter for the overall structure. If multiple apply, choose the best fit. Output ONLY the letter.
