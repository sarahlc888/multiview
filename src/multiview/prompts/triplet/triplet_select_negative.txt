Given an anchor document, please find a document that is DISSIMILAR to the anchor based on the specified criteria.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

INSTRUCTIONS:
- An ideal candidate is DIFFERENT from the anchor, based on the criterion, but LOOKS SIMILAR on the surface. Prefer candidates with high Lexical similarity (bm25) and/or high spurious tag similarity but low criterion similarity. This creates a "hard negative" - a document that would fool a naive similarity model but is actually different on what matters.
- Don't pick documents with "subtle" differences on the criterion -- we want clear criterion differences with superficial similarities
- NOTE: Each candidate is annotated with  "Criterion" (similarity on what matters), "Spurious" (similarity on surface features), and "Lexical" (BM25 word overlap)
- IMPORTANT: Annotations are noisy. Always verify against actual document content.
