We are finding documents that are DIFFERENT based on specific criteria.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

ANCHOR DOCUMENT:
{anchor_doc}

ANCHOR ANNOTATION:
{anchor_annotation}

CANDIDATES:
{candidates}
{triplet_example_section}
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Select a document that is CLEARLY DIFFERENT on the criterion (look for LOW Criterion similarity, ideally < 0.5)
- But LOOKS SIMILAR on surface features (look for HIGH Spurious similarity, ideally > 0.5)
- The "Spurious tags" show surface-level features that are NOT part of the criterion but might confuse simple models
- IMPORTANT: Prefer candidates with HIGH Lexical similarity (>30). High BM25 word overlap indicates the document shares many words with the anchor, making it a harder negative for lexical models to distinguish.
- This creates a "hard negative" - a document that would fool a naive similarity model but is actually different on what matters
- Don't pick documents with "subtle" differences on the criterion - we want clear criterion differences with superficial similarities

NOTE: Each candidate shows "Criterion" (similarity on what matters), "Spurious" (similarity on surface features), and "Lexical" (BM25 word overlap).
We want low Criterion, high Spurious, AND high Lexical for the best hard negatives.

However, Annotations are noisy predictions -- always verify against actual content.
