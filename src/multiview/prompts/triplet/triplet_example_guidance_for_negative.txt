TRIPLET EXAMPLE GUIDANCE:
This example illustrates what makes a good NEGATIVE for this criterion.

[Anchor document]
{anchor_ex}
[POSITIVE - Similar on criterion]
{pos_ex}
[GOOD NEGATIVE - CLEARLY different on criterion but superficially similar]
{neg_ex}

Your task: Find a candidate that is CLEARLY DIFFERENT from the anchor on the criterion (low T similarity), but looks similar on surface features (high S similarity). This creates a hard negative that would confuse a naive model.
