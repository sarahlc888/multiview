You are designing a tag schema to identify SPURIOUS (surface-level) similarities between documents.

CRITERION OF INTEREST: {criterion}

CRITERION DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Your task is to create a tag schema that captures dimensions of variation that:
1. Are INDEPENDENT of the criterion "{criterion}" (not relevant to it)
2. Capture superficial or surface-level properties of documents
3. Could cause two documents to APPEAR similar even though they differ on the criterion
4. Could be used to identify confounders or spurious correlations

For example, if the criterion is "mathematical operations used", spurious tags might include:
- Word problem context (shopping, time, school, etc.)
- Presence of specific entities (money, people, objects)
- Problem length (short, medium, long)
- Numeric ranges used (small numbers, large numbers)

These are properties that don't affect what operations are used, but might cause superficial similarity.

IMPORTANT:
- Tags should be BINARY (yes/no, present/absent)
- Tags should be INDEPENDENT of the criterion
- Tags should capture SUPERFICIAL similarities
- Aim for 5-10 tags that cover different aspects of spurious similarity
- Each tag should be clearly defined

Return valid JSON with reasoning:
{
  "reasoning": "Explain what spurious/superficial properties you identified and why these tags capture surface-level similarities independent of the criterion",
  "tags": [
    {"name": "tag_name", "description": "when to apply this tag"},
    ...
  ]
}
