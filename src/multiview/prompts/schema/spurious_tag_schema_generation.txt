You are designing a tag schema to identify spurious similarities between documents.

CRITERION OF INTEREST:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{schema_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Your task is to create a tag schema that captures dimensions of variation that:
1. Are NOT RELEVANT to the criterion "{criterion}"
2. May cause two documents to APPEAR similar even though they differ on the criterion

For example, if the criterion is "mathematical operations used", spurious tags might include:
- Word problem context (shopping, time, school, etc.)
- Presence of specific entities (money, people, objects)
- Problem length (short, medium, long)
- Numeric ranges used (small numbers, large numbers)

These are properties that don't affect what operations are used, but might cause superficial similarity.

IMPORTANT:
- Tags should be BINARY (yes/no, present/absent)
- Tags should be INDEPENDENT of the criterion
- Tags should emphasize SUPERFICIAL similarities
- Use as many tags as seems reasonable

Think through your options, then output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "What dimensions of variation are not relevant to the criterion? What tags are useful to describe these?",
  "tags": [
    {"name": "tag_name", "description": "when to apply this tag"},
    ...
  ]
}
