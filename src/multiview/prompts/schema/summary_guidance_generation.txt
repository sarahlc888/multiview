Create guidelines for annotating how documents relate to a criterion.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{summary_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Your task is to create a demonstration for how to annotate a document with respect to the criterion.

The annotation should include two sections:
1) Annotation trace: freeform text with justification and references to the document
2) Final summary: concise, structured summary
  - Try to use as structured of a format as possible. Prefer not to use prose. If the hint specifies a desired format, the final summary should follow that format.
  - Should not reference the specifics of the document unless there's no other way to illustrate the point
  - Should be invariant to spurious factors
  - If two documents are similar with respect to the criterion, their final summaries should have high lexical overlap

Include a demonstration showing both sections for one example document.

Output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "<thinking out loud about how to provide a good demonstration>",
  "summary_guidance": "..."
}
