Create guidelines for annotating how documents relate to a criterion.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{summary_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Your task is to create a "golden" demonstration for how to create a criteria annotation.

The annotation should include two sections:
1) Annotation trace: freeform text with justification and explicit references to the document
2) Final summary: concise, structured summary
  - Prefer not to use prose. The format should be as structured as possible. If the hint specifies a desired format, the final summary should follow that format.
  - If two documents are similar with respect to the criterion, their final summaries should have high lexical overlap
  - IMPORTANT: Should not explicitly reference or quote the document. The summary should be invariant to everything except the most essential criteria-specific attributes.

Include a demonstration showing both outputs for one example document.

Output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "<thinking out loud about how to provide a good demonstration>",
  "summary_guidance": "..."
}
