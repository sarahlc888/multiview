Below are a few randomly sampled documents from a corpus. We are going to analyze these documents using this criteria: "{criterion}"

Our downstream goal is to create concise summaries that describe how each document relates to this criteria. However, the criteria is just a short free text string, which could be somewhat ambiguous. In order to make it easier to create consistent, high-quality summaries, we need to provide a more detailed description.

Your task is to create this richer description.

For example, for a straightforward criteria like "color" for a dataset of images, we could
create a criteria description such as "What are the dominant color or colors in the image,
e.g. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, grey, white, black, brown". Since color
is a property that has discrete categories, the description lists out salient categories
almost like class labels.

For a more complex criteria like "literary themes" for a dataset of short stories, we could
create a criteria description such as: "literary themes: what are some of the biggest thematic
preoccupations of the story? Does the story relate to any universal themes like love,
mortality, greed? Does the story make reference to any well-known prior works?" Even
though there are not clear "class labels" to use here, it is useful to provide examples
of some archetypes that could appear.

DOCUMENT TYPE:
{document_type}

CRITERIA CONTEXT:
{criterion_description}

SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

YOUR TASK:
Create a richer criteria description for "{criterion}" that will help create downstream summaries.

Be specific and provide examples where helpful. Keep it under 200 words.

Think out loud, then output your final criteria description after the delimiter.

After the delimiter "---FINAL OUTPUT---", return ONLY the criteria description text.
