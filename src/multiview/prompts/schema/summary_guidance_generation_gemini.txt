You are designing annotation guidance for free-text summaries.

CRITERION: {criterion}

CRITERION DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

SUMMARY HINT (optional):
{guidance_hint}

DESIRED FORMAT (optional):
{format_hint}

SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

The summary should include two sections:
1) Annotation trace: freeform text with justification and references to the document.
2) Final summary: concise, structured, high lexical overlap for similar documents; invariant to spurious factors; should not reference the specifics of the document unless there's no other way to illustrate the point.

If a desired format is specified above, the final summary should follow that format.

Include a short demonstration showing how to produce both fields for one example document.

Think through multiple candidate guidance options, then choose the single best option.
Return valid JSON with reasoning:
{
  "reasoning": "Explain what guidance options you considered and why this approach best helps annotators create useful summaries",
  "summary_guidance": "..."
}
