Create guidelines for annotating how documents relate to a criterion.

DOCUMENT TYPE:
{document_type}

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{summary_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Your task is to create a "golden" demonstration for how to create a criteria annotation.

The annotation should include two sections:
1) Annotation trace: freeform text with justification and explicit references to the document
2) Final summary: a single, concise sentence of prose
  - The final summary MUST be exactly one sentence in natural language prose
  - Capture the essence of how the document relates to the criterion
  - If two documents are similar with respect to the criterion, their final summaries should have high lexical overlap
  - The summary should be high level and abstract away from specific details in the document
  - IMPORTANT: Should not explicitly reference or quote the document. The summary should be invariant to everything except the most essential criteria-specific attributes.

Include a demonstration showing both outputs for one example document.

Output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "<thinking out loud about how to provide a good demonstration>",
  "summary_guidance": "..."
}
