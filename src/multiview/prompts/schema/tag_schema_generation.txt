Design a tagging schema to annotate how documents relate to a criterion.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{schema_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

GUIDELINES:
- Each tag is a boolean attribute that either applies or doesn't
- Documents can have multiple tags, one tag, or no tags
- Be comprehensive — capture the full range of variation you see
- If there's a finite set of values, enumerate them (e.g., color → red, blue, green...)
- If the criterion has independent dimensions, factorize them (e.g., weather → temperature_cold, temperature_hot, precipitation_rain, precipitation_snow...)
- Use as many tags as seems reasonable

Think through your options, then output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "How do documents relate to the criterion? What is the range of variation? What kinds of tags were considered? Why these tags capture variation along the criterion",
  "tags": [
    {"name": "tag_name", "description": "when this tag applies"},
    ...
  ]
}
