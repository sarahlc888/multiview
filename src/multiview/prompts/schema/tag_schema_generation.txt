You are designing a tagging schema to annotate documents based on a specific lens/criteria.

CRITERIA: {criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

TAG SCHEMA HINT (optional):
{schema_hint}

Here are {n_samples} randomly sampled documents from the corpus (showing all fields):

{sample_documents}

Your task: Create a tagging schema with tags that capture different aspects of how documents relate to the criteria "{criterion}".

IMPORTANT: Tags are NOT mutually exclusive. A document can have multiple tags or no tags. Think of tags as binary attributes.

GUIDELINES:
- Tags should be relevant to the criteria
- Each tag should represent a single, clear attribute that either does or does not apply to a given document
- There is no limit on the number of tags. Use as many as seems reasonable. A little bit of redundancy is OK, but use your judgement. The priority is to capture the range of variation across documents as much as possible.
- If there is a finite, enumerable set of options or prototypes, enumerate them. For example, color -> [red, yellow, green, ...]
- If the decision space can be factorized into independent attributes, do so. For example, weather -> [temperature_hot, temperature_mild, temperature_cold, precipitation_rain, precipitation_none, precipitation_snow, ...]. Another example: sports team records for a 10-game season -> [game1_win, game1_loss, game2_win, game2_loss, ...]. Another example: action_sequence with actions {A,B,C,None} → [step1_A, step1_B, step1_C, step1_None, step2_A, ...]

Think through multiple candidate tag schemas before choosing the final one.

Output valid JSON with reasoning:
{
  "reasoning": "Explain what tag options you considered and why you chose these specific tags to capture variation along the criteria",
  "tags": [
    {"name": "tag_name", "description": "when this tag applies"},
    ...
  ]
}
