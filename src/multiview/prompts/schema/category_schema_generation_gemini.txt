You have a set of unlabeled documents and a criterion of interest. Your task is to design a category schema that captures how the documents vary with respect to the criterion.

CRITERION: {criterion}

CRITERION DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

SCHEMA HINT (optional):
{schema_hint}

SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

Think about what kind of candidate schemas are possible.
- The ideal candidate schema partitions the output space into discrete categories.
- If there is a way to enumerate a closed set of categories, that would be best, but if not, it's OK to include an 'other' category.
- Try to choose a number of categories that reflects the range of variation within the sample documents.

Choose the single best schema strategy and return it in valid JSON with reasoning:
{
  "reasoning": "Explain your schema choice: what alternatives you considered and why this schema best captures variation along the criteria",
  "categories": [{"name": "...", "description": "..."}, ...]
}
