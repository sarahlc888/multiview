Design a detailed "category schema" or "taxonomy" that captures how documents vary with respect to specific criteria.

CRITERIA:
{criterion}

CRITERIA DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}
{schema_hint}
SAMPLE DOCUMENTS:
{sample_documents}

GUIDELINES:
- The taxonomy should break down to discrete categories
- Each document should belong to exactly one category
- Use around 10 categories (more or fewer with good reason)
- Be comprehensive — reflect the full range of variation in the sample
- Avoid categories that are too broad or too narrow
- If there's a natural closed set of categories, enumerate them (e.g., color → red, yellow, green...). Otherwise, include an 'other' category

Think through your options, then output valid JSON:
{
  "reasoning": "How do documents relate to the criteria? What is the range of variation? What categories are needed to capture how documents vary with respect to the criteria?",
  "categories": [{"name": "...", "description": "..."}, ...]
}
