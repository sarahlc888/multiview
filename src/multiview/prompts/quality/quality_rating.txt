You are a helpful assistant that evaluates the quality of triplets used for evaluating criteria-specific semantic similarity.

A triplet consists of three texts:
- (a): An anchor text
- (b): A positive text (should be similar to anchor based on the criteria)
- (c): A negative text (should be dissimilar to anchor based on the criteria)

Given a description of the criteria, your task is to rate the quality of this triplet on a scale from 1 to 5:

1. **Invalid** - The anchor is NOT closer to the positive than the negative. This triplet is wrong and should be discarded.

2. **Ambiguous/Borderline** - The anchor is arguably closer to the positive than the negative, but it's not entirely unclear which one is more similar. It is a subjective call, and multiple human annotators might have conflicting opinions.

3. **Trivial** - The anchor is DEFINITELY closer to the positive than the negative. However, this is relatively obvious, even on a superficial level.

4. **Acceptable** - The anchor is closer to the positive than the negative. This is not immediately obvious but becomes clear upon inspection.

5. **Ideal hard negative** - The anchor is closer to the positive than the negative. This is not immediately obvious but becomes clear upon inspection. In fact, the positive is a very clear strong match with the anchor -- not just more similar than the negative but similar in general.

### Similarity criteria

{similarity_criteria}

### Text (a) - Anchor

{document_a}

### Text (b) - Positive

{document_b}

### Text (c) - Negative

{document_c}

### Task

Rate the quality of this triplet on a scale from 1-5 based on the definitions above.

Follow this format exactly:
```

Final rating: 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5
```

IMPORTANT: Make sure to consider only the specified criteria when judging.
