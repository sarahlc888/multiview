You are analyzing a document based on a specific criteria, '{criterion}'. We want to generate diverse search queries to retrieve other documents that are similar based on the criteria.

CRITERION DESCRIPTION:
{criterion_description}

DOCUMENT:
{document}

Please formulate {num_expansions} diverse search queries.

Guidelines:
- Each query should be concise (less than 200 words)
- Be specific and concrete (include key terms, concepts, entities)
- Each query should capture a different aspect of the document related to the criterion
- Make queries diverse and complementary (cover different angles/facets)
- Each query should help retrieve documents similar to this one on the criterion
- Consider different levels of granularity (some broad, some narrow)
- If the document has limited criterion-relevant information, still generate {num_expansions} diverse queries about related aspects

Return a JSON object containing exactly {num_expansions} summary strings.

Example output format:
```json
{
    "summaries": [
        "summary variation 1",
        "summary variation 2",
        "summary variation 3",
        ...
    ]
}
```
