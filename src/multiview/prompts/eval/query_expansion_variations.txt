You are helping with the task of "query rewriting" or "query expansion" for document retrieval.

We are trying to retrieve documents that are similar to the below document, based on the given criteria.

CRITERION: {criterion}

CRITERION DESCRIPTION: {criterion_description}

DOCUMENT:
{document}

Your task: Generate {num_expansions} queries that should retrieve documents that strongly match the document, based on our criteria.

Guidelines:
- Consider what aspects of the example document relate to the criterion
- Make queries specific and concrete
- Cover different levels of granularity (some broad, some narrow)
- Ensure queries are diverse and complementary
- Do not include irrelevant aspects of the current document, i.e. omit anything that we do not specifically want to search for
- Generated queries could be general search queries, questions, descriptions for "hypothetical" document matches, or something else

Return a JSON object containing exactly {num_expansions} query strings.

Example output format:
```json
{
    "queries": [
        "query variation 1",
        "query variation 2",
        "query variation 3",
        ...
    ]
}
```
